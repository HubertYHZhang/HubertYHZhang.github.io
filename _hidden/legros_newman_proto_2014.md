Two periods: 1 and 2. $1-\eta$ are active agents, $\eta$ are nerds. Among the active agents, $r$ are entrepreneurs, $1-r$ are workers. All agents are risk neutral and endowed with one unit of effort, with which active agents can produce final goods and nerds can produce inventions. Entrepreneurs can hire up to $n\geq 2$ workers. Nerds observe in the 1st period and may invent something and sell the patent in the 2nd period.

Production function:

$$y = \exp(\int_0^1 \log[\alpha(i) l(i)] di)$$

Labor is uniformly distributed on the job continuum. The output per worker is $A \equiv \exp(\int_0^1 \log[\alpha(i)] di)$.

If an entrepreneur works on his own, he gets $\alpha A$, where $n/2 \geq \alpha \geq 1$. Therefore, if he hires any positive number of workers, he must be employing $n$ workers.

Quality ladder style innovation: $A' = A (1+\gamma)^m$, where $m = \int_0^1 m(j) dj$ is the total number of innovations. Each nerd can at most produce one innovation.

***Division of labor***. The set of jobs can be divided into $\sigma$ sets, each set contains $1/\sigma$ jobs. Cost of division of labor lies in coordination. Each worker pays $c(\sigma - 1)$ to coordinate with other workers. Benefits come from monitoring. 

$$ \max_{w,\sigma} n(1-c(\sigma - 1) - w)A$$

$$s.t.\quad w\geq \frac{\mu}{\sigma - 1}$$

$$wA \geq u^\ast$$

*Now I find it not relevant to my research. Let me finish this later.*
