"Whoever thinks that principal-agent model is only about effort is incredibly na√Øve." -- *Bengt Holmstrom*

About how a person's concern for future affects his current efforts. His productive abilities are revealed over time through observations of performance. There is no explicit contract, but each period the wage hinges on the expected output, which links today's payoff to future wages.

Congruence between the firm's financial concern and the individual's concern for human capital return may be low. Career concern may thus be beneficial or detrimental.

# Basic Model

Consider a manager operating in a competitive labor market. If there is no uncertainty in his characteristics, he has no incentive to work (competitive wage = cost).

Talent measurement $\eta$ with a normal prior. Mean $m$. Precision $h_0$ (the inverse of variance). The final product is determined by three components: ability, effort, and a noise.

$$ y_t = \eta + a_t + \varepsilon_t $$

Each period, the market observes the worker's history $y^{t-1}$ and posts a wage $w(y^{t-1})$ to her. Due to perfect competition, the wage should equal the worker's expected output.

$$ w_t(y^{t-1}) = \mathbb{E}[\eta \lvert y^{t-1}] + a_t^\ast $$

The market should use Bayes' rule to update the belief of $\eta$. Define $z_t\equiv \eta + \varepsilon_t + a_t - a_t^\ast = y_t - a_t^\ast$. Let $h_t$ denote the precision of $m_t$. It is easy to show that 

$$ \mathbb{E}[\eta \lvert y^{t+1}] = \frac{h_{t}\mathbb{E}[\eta\lvert y^{t}] + h_\varepsilon z_t}{h_{t} + h_\varepsilon}$$
$$ h_{t+1} = h_{t} + h_\varepsilon = h_1 + th_\varepsilon $$

Using the law of motion of $h_t$, we can get
$$ \mathbb{E}[\eta \lvert y^{t-1}] = \frac{h_1m_1 + h_\varepsilon \sum_1^{t-1} z_s}{h_1 + t h_\varepsilon} $$
