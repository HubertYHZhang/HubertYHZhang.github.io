*A model about integration and coordination in a market equilibrium.*
# Settings
**Production:**
There is one consumer good, the production of with requires two parties, $A$ and $B$. Denote the decision of $A$ as $a\in [0,1]$ and similarly for $B$. The identity of the decision maker will be determined by the ownership structure. The final output is $1$ with a probability $1-(a-b)^2$.
The managers of the two parties have a private cost of making decisions. What is easy for one is hard for the other. Specifically, manager $A$'s utility is $y^A - (1-a)^2$, and $y^B - b^2$ for $B$.

***Assumption:*** limited liability $y^i \geq 0$. No any means of side payments (enter the scene with zero cash endowments). This is to make the ownership structure dependent on supplier market conditions.

**Integration**: the $HQ$ will make the decision without private costs. Utility $y^H$

**Contract**: Under non-integration, $A$ gets $s$ share of the revenue and $B$ gets $1-s$. Under integration, $HQ$ buys the assets of $A,B$ for prices of $\pi_A$ and $\pi_B$ in exchange for a share structure $\mathbf{s} = (s_A,s_B,s_H)$ where the sum of the three is $1$.

**Coalitions (enterprises)**:** Coalitions consisting of $A$ and $B$ vs. Coalitions consisting of $A$ and $B$ and $HQ$.

**Define an equilibrium**:
- *Feasibility*. The payoffs paid to the agents must be feasible within the coalition under the equilibrium price $P$.
- *Stability*. No coalition can form and find feasible payoff for its members that are strictly greater than their equilibrium payoffs.
- *Market clearing*. $S(P) = D(P)$.
