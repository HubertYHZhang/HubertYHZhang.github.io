Abreu, Pearce, and Stacchetti (1990): we only need to look the equilibrium payoffs first, and then the equilibrium can be constructed through the recursive relationships. In general, we look at non-stationary equilibria.

We can look at the payoff frontier (which we can derive later).

Suppose an equilibrium payoff vector is our focus. The payoff may be supported by either $L$ or $R$ action.

$$ f(u_1) = \max_{a\in\{L,R\}}{(1-\delta) F_2(a) + \delta f(u_1^a)} $$
